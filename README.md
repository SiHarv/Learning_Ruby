# Ruby Practice Workspace

This repository contains various Ruby scripts and practice files for learning and experimenting with core Ruby concepts. The files included cover topics such as string manipulation, hash CRUD operations, and interactive command-line prompts.

## Files Overview

- **caesar_cipher.rb**: Implementation of the classic Caesar cipher encryption algorithm.
- **CRUD_Hash.rb**: Script demonstrating Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on Ruby Hashes.
- **practice.rb**: General Ruby practice file for experimenting with different Ruby features and syntax from TheOdinProject
- **tty_prompt.rb**: Example usage of the `tty-prompt` gem for interactive command-line prompts and implemented in simple     projects above
- **Gemfile**: Specifies gem dependencies for the workspace.

## Note
I will be moving to Ruby on Rails today. (Repo link will be added here soon.)
